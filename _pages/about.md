My name is Zhiyuan Zhu. I'll become a phD student at the [Computer Science Department of Zhejiang University](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) in September 2024. My research interests mainly lie in neuromorphic computing and computational neuroscience.

I'm very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Qian Zheng](https://q-zh.github.io/) from the Laboratory of Brain Machine Intelligence in Zhejiang University. 

I'd be very happy to exchange ideas and thoughts with anyone interested in this topic. I will regularly upodate my observations and thoughts related to this field on my blog post. Let's change the world with neuromorphic computing!
