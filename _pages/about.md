My name is Zhiyuan Zhu. I'll become a phD student at the Computer Science Department of Zhejiang University in September 2024. My research interests mainly lie in neuromorphic computing and computational neuroscience. I'd be very happy to exchange ideas and thoughts with anyone interested in this topic. I will regularly upodate my observations and thoughts related to this field on my blog post. Let's change the world with neuromorphic computing!
